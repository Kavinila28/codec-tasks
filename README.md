## AI Internship @ Codec technologies
During my AI internship at Codec, I built two hands‑on mini‑projects that demonstrate the fundamentals of text and image classification—all with a single library and no external downloads.

# 1. Spam Email Classifier
Goal: Automatically flag incoming messages as “spam” or “not spam.”

Approach:

Collected a small set of example sentences and labeled each one.

Converted text into numerical features.

Trained a simple probabilistic model to learn the difference between spammy wording and regular messages.

Outcome: A lightweight script that instantly tells you whether any new sentence is likely spam.

# 2. Handwritten Digit Reader
Goal: Recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from small grayscale images.

Approach:

Leveraged a built‑in digits dataset (no downloads required).

Split the images into training and testing groups.

Trained a compact neural‑style classifier to map pixel patterns to digit labels.

Outcome: A standalone tool that achieves high-90s accuracy on unseen digit images in seconds.
